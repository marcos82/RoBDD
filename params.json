{"name":"RoBDD","tagline":"Robolectric BDD","body":"RoBDD\r\n=====\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Axxiss/RoBDD.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Axxiss/RoBDD)\r\n\r\nRoBDD stands for Robolectric BDD.\r\n\r\nRoBDD is the glue between [Gherkin][3] and [Robolectric][1]. Providing developers a tool to create Android apps\r\nfollowing BDD principles without the need to run the test on an AVD.\r\n\r\nTo avoid using this set of predefined steps wrongly, please take a look at the article  [The training wheels came off][4]\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent status\r\n==============\r\n\r\nCurrently only some stepsdefs are defined, without Gherkin support. I intend to\r\nadd support to Gherkin in a future, right now I need to find out how to run\r\nboth cucumber and robolectric runners on the same test.\r\n\r\nSo if you know gow to do it, please get in touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo.\r\n2. Add it as a dependency into your project.\r\n3. Start testing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTake a look to steps folder under test.\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n==========\r\n\r\nIf you missing a feature or a current feature is not working correctly, you can\r\ncontribute by adding/fixing it. You just need to follow a quite simple\r\nguidelines:\r\n\r\n1. Comments: Relevant comments must be added.\r\n2. Code style: Follow Android code style.\r\n3. Test: All PRs must have tests and obviously test must pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis software is released under GPLv3.
